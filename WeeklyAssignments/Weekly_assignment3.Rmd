#### Data looks good. I'll need to work with the data from the last 5 columns. Looks like the numbers are decimals which can be converted to percents. Will need to `pivot` data from `wide` to `long`.

***
```{r}
long_bison <- bison_data %>%
  rename(Legume=Leg, WarmGrass=C4G, CoolGrass=C3G) %>%  #renaming certain columns to their common name
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("WarmGrass", "Forb", "Legume", "CoolGrass", "Woody"), #specify which columns you want to make longer
    names_to = "FunctionalGroup",   #name of new column
    values_to = "Percent_in_diet",  #name of a new column which will contain values
    values_drop_na = TRUE           #removes any values where the values = NA
  ) %>%
  filter(MonthNum != 10)            #filter out October since that was not graphed. (Maybe due to lack of obs)

glimpse(long_bison)
```

#### Looks like we successfully created a new column with grass types (`FunctionalGroup`) and the `Percent_in_diet` next to it.
***

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data=long_bison,             #data
            aes(x=reorder(Month, MonthNum), #put the months in order
                y= Percent_in_diet,         #use the percent in diet for y axis
                fill = FunctionalGroup)) +  #group data by FunctionalGroup and give it color
  geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity") +  #position ="fill" makes the bars stack and stretch to top
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Percent in Diet") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + #convert y axis to percents
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/2) #make the graph longer
  
plot
```

* Looks like they used R and didn't play with the design of the figure too much
* Below this is how I would have customized the figure
