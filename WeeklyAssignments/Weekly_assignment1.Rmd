3. Name the file `index`
4. This will automatically populate with default text so delete everything except for the header (A.K.A. YAML)
5. Type anything into the body of the document and click save
6. Name the file `index` when you save it

### 7. Uploading to your Github Repository
1. Where your console is currently open, click on Terminal
2. In Terminal type `git status`
  + This will show you what unsaved changes you have
3. Type `git add -A` to add all changes
4. Type `git commit -am "<description of changes>"`
5. Type `git push`
  + This will prompt you for your Github username
  + If it asks for the password, put the access token we generated earlier
  + Once complete, if there are any errors do these 4 steps
  + In Console, run `install.packages("credentials")`
  + In Terminal, run `git config --global user.email "put github email here"`
  + In Terminal, run `git config --global user.name "put your name here"`
