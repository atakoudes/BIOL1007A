Use the RMarkdown cheat sheet and create an .Rmd with the following:

A picture
A 3x5 table
A few sentences that use bold and italic formatting
A bulleted list
A numbered list
A link to a website
Multiple sized headers.
A superscript and subscript.
An equation
Plain text within fencing

 THIS  | IS A | TABLE | COLUMN 4 | COLUMNS 5
-------------  | ------------- | ---------- | -------
Table Cell     | Cell 2        | data | data | data
Cell 3         | Cell 4        | data 2 | data | data
more data | even more data | too much data | data | data

I am learning to use **bold** writing and *italic* writing. These help me **emphasize** certain *words* which are important to the reader's understanding.

This is my to-do list

* clean room

* do laundry
  + make sure to separate delicates

* make bed

This is a numbered list:

1. most important

2. second most important
  + make sure to do this too
  
3. least important
