#### For my final project, I decided to use create a Shiny App which uses the built in `mpg` dataset. Shiny apps allow you to create interactive web applications. See the [gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) for some examples
***

```{r}
library(knitr)

include_app("https://atakoudes.shinyapps.io/app-1/", height="600px")
```

#### There are two main components to a Shiny App
* The `ui` is what the user interacts with. This contains the buttons, options for the buttons etc.
* The `server` is what happens behind the scenes. This renders the figures and changes them based on user inputs.

```{r, eval=F}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Interactive Bar Chart"),
  
  sidebarLayout(       #this activates a sidebar layout mode as you can see in the example
    sidebarPanel(      #this is where you customize the sidebar panel
      p("This is the sidebar panel"),
      selectInput("x_axis", 
                  label = "Select a variable to group by",
                  choices = c("Make", "Drive", "Class", "Fuel"),
                  selected = "Class"),
```

#### While a lot of this code looks unfamiliar, there are some recognizable parts.
* The output uses a ggplot which we we have become familiar with this semester.
* The `$` is used by the server to reference inputs from the user in the same way we use it to reference parts of a data frame.

#### When typing text into a Shiny App, you must use the `html` language

##### Images take an argument `src` which is the path to the image

```{r, eval=F}
img(src = "my_image.png", height = 72, width = 72)
```

#### There are a lot of different options for interactive buttons

##### Shiny will store inputs from the user meaning you can use the `$` to reference a specific button's input

```{r, eval=F}
yvar <- switch(input$y_axis, 
                    "Highway" = mpg$hwy, 
                    "City" = mpg$cty, 
                    "Displacement" = mpg$displ, 
                    "Cylinders" = mpg$cyl)
```
